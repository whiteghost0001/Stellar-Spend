1. Connect your Stellar wallet (Freighter or Lobstr)
2. Enter the USDC amount you want to convert
3. Select your destination currency and bank
4. Enter your bank account details
5. Review the rate and fees, then confirm in your wallet
6. Funds settle to your bank in 5–15 minutes

Requirements:
• Minimum transfer: 0.70 USDC
• A Stellar wallet with USDC balance
• Enough XLM for network fees (if paying gas in XLM)
• Your wallet must be on Mainnet (not Testnet)`,

    content: `Stellar-Spend is a non-custodial off-ramp application.

Non-custodial means:
• We never hold your funds at any point
• All transactions are signed by you in your own wallet
• You remain in full control of your assets

How it works:
1. Your USDC travels from Stellar → Base chain via Allbridge
2. The server sends Base USDC to Paycrest
3. Paycrest converts it to fiat and initiates a bank transfer
4. Your beneficiary receives local currency (NGN, KES, GHS, …)

Supported stablecoins: USDC, USDT (Stellar-issued)`,

Freighter setup:
• Install from freighter.app
• Create or import a Stellar account
• Switch the network to Mainnet (Settings → Network → Mainnet)

Lobstr setup:
• Use the Lobstr browser extension or mobile companion
• Approve the WalletConnect pairing request

Troubleshooting:
• "Extension not installed" — install the extension and refresh

Stellar requires every account to hold a base reserve (currently 1 XLM) plus 0.5 XLM per trustline. Attempting to drop below the reserve will cause the transaction to fail.

If you see "Insufficient XLM balance for native gas fee":
• Switch the gas fee payment to USDC instead of XLM
• Add more XLM to your account
• Reduce the transfer amount slightly

Dual input is useful when:
• You need an exact fiat payout (e.g., paying an exact bill)
• You want to send your full USDC balance (enter in USDC mode)

Bridge Fee: ~0.3%–0.5% of the transfer amount

Platform Fee: 0.35% of the transfer amount
• Covers operational costs and compliance

Network Fee: Fixed ~2.50 USDC equivalent
• Covers Stellar and Base gas costs
• Can be paid in XLM or USDC (your choice)

Paycrest Payout Fee: 0% (no additional fee)
• Paycrest does not charge extra for fiat settlement

Total fees are shown on the quote screen before you confirm. The "You receive" amount is the final fiat payout after all deductions.

FAQ — Why does my payout differ from the displayed amount?
Minor rate changes during bridge processing (< 1 minute) may cause small differences. Rates are locked at bridge submission, not at quote time.`,

XLM method:
• Gas deducted from your XLM balance on Stellar
• Your USDC amount is fully used for the transfer
• Requires sufficient XLM above the minimum reserve

USDC method:
• Gas deducted from your USDC transfer amount
• Net USDC bridged is slightly less
• Useful when XLM is low

Recommendation: Use USDC fee if your XLM balance is near the minimum reserve.`,

4. Confirm the name matches your intended recipient before proceeding

Common verification errors:
• "Account not found" — check the account number and selected bank
• "Verification unavailable" — retry; this is usually a temporary API issue
• Name mismatch — verify you selected the correct bank and entered the right number

Important: Always confirm the displayed account name before sending funds. Transactions to the wrong account cannot be reversed once the bridge has settled.`,

Where to track:

• Email / push notification (if notifications are enabled)

If status is stuck for more than 30 minutes, see the Troubleshooting section or contact support.`,

Refund eligibility:
• Transactions qualify for refund within 24 hours of initiation

1. Go to /history

Stellar network congestion:
• High transaction volume may slow bridge confirmation
• Usually resolves within 15 minutes

Allbridge bridge processing:
• The bridge waits for multiple confirmations on both chains
• Peak hours may add 5–10 minutes

Paycrest bank processing:
• Bank transfers depend on your bank's clearing schedule
• Weekend and holiday transfers may take until the next business day
• Mobile money (M-Pesa, etc.) typically settles faster

If your transfer is stuck for more than 30 minutes at "Bridging":
• Check the Allbridge status page
• Check Stellar.Expert for the transaction hash

This minimum exists because:
• Fixed network fees (~2.50 USDC) would exceed the transfer amount for very small sends
• The Paycrest payout system has minimum order sizes per currency

For most corridors, sending less than $5 USDC will result in a very small fiat payout after fees. We recommend transfers of at least $10 USDC for meaningful payouts.`,
