## Triggering Alerts
- ALERT_NAME

## Impact
One-sentence description of user / business impact.

- On-call Slack channel: #ops-alerts

## Detection
How the incident is typically first noticed.

## Diagnosis Steps
Step-by-step triage commands and checks.

## Mitigation Steps
Actions to restore service, ordered by preference (quick wins first).

## Escalation
- If unresolved after 15 min → escalate to [Role] via [Channel]

## Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Response SLA | First Escalation | Second Escalation |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| P1 — Service down / funds at risk | 15 min | Infra lead (Slack DM + phone) | CTO + Legal (if funds impacted) |
| P2 — Degraded / partial outage | 30 min | Infra lead (Slack) | Engineering manager |
| P3 — Non-critical / monitoring | 2 h | Async Slack | N/A |

On-call rotation: managed in PagerDuty. See `#ops-oncall` for current schedule.

## Post-Incident Review (PIR) Process

1. **Within 24 h** — Incident commander creates a PIR doc from [post-incident-review.md](./post-incident-review.md).
2. **Within 48 h** — Engineering team completes the five-whys analysis.
3. **Within 1 week** — Action items assigned with owners and due dates.
4. **Monthly** — PIR summaries reviewed in engineering all-hands.

→ **PIR template:** [`docs/runbooks/post-incident-review.md`](./post-incident-review.md)
