# Dependency Update Policy

## Overview

This document describes how Stellar-Spend manages third-party dependencies to reduce supply-chain risk while keeping the project current.

## Automated Updates (Renovate)

Renovate Bot runs on a weekly schedule and opens PRs automatically.

### Schedule

| Update type | Schedule | Auto-merge |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| Patch updates | Monday before 06:00 UTC | ✅ Yes (after CI passes) |
| Minor/major updates | Monday before 06:00 UTC | ❌ No — requires review |
| Dev dependencies | Monday before 06:00 UTC | ✅ Yes |
| Lockfile maintenance | First of month, before 04:00 UTC | ✅ Yes |
| Security/vulnerability | Immediately | ❌ No — requires review |

### Grouped PRs

| Group | Packages |
|-------|----------|
| `stellar-core-deps` | `@stellar/*`, `@allbridge/*`, `viem` |
| `nextjs-react` | `next`, `react`, `react-dom` |
| `typescript-types` | `@types/*` |
| `dev-dependencies` | All `devDependencies` |

### Configuration

See `.github/renovate.json` for the full Renovate configuration.

## CI Checks on Dependency PRs

Every dependency PR (Renovate or manual) must pass all of the following jobs in `vulnerability-scanning.yml`:

| Job | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `lockfile-integrity` | Verifies `package-lock.json` is in sync and uses lockfileVersion ≥ 2 (includes integrity hashes) |
| `license-check` | Fails on disallowed licenses (GPL, AGPL, LGPL, CDDL, EPL) |
| `provenance-check` | Runs `npm audit signatures` and flags typosquatting candidates |
| `npm-audit` | Fails on `moderate`+ vulnerabilities |
| `dependency-check` | Snyk deep scan at `high` severity threshold |
| `container-scan` | Trivy scan for HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs in the Docker image |

## Disallowed Licenses

The following licenses are blocked in production dependencies:

- GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0
- AGPL-1.0, AGPL-3.0
- LGPL-2.0, LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0
- CDDL-1.0
- EPL-1.0, EPL-2.0

If a required package uses a disallowed license, raise it with the team lead before merging.

## Lockfile Integrity

- `package-lock.json` **must** be committed and kept in sync.
- `lockfileVersion` must be 2 or 3 (includes `integrity` SHA-512 hashes for every package).
- CI verifies the lockfile is not out of sync with `package.json` on every PR.
- Run `npm ci` (not `npm install`) in all CI jobs and Docker builds to use the locked versions.

## Responding to Vulnerability Alerts

1. **Critical/High**: Address within 48 hours. If no patch exists, evaluate mitigations or removal.
2. **Moderate**: Address within 2 weeks or next scheduled Renovate cycle.
3. **Low**: Address in the next Renovate batch.

Snyk and `npm audit` reports are uploaded as CI artifacts for each run.

## Manual Updates

When updating a dependency manually:

```bash
# Update a specific package to latest compatible version
npm install <package>@latest

# Commit both package.json and package-lock.json together
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore(deps): update <package> to vX.Y.Z"
```

Always run `npm test` and `npm run build` locally before pushing.
