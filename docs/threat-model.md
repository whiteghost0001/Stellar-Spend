# Stellar-Spend Threat Model

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2026-06-28
**Status:** Living document — review before each mainnet deployment and after every significant
architectural change.
**Author:** Security lead + contributors (see §9)

## 1. Scope

This threat model covers the complete Stellar-Spend off-ramp **and** on-ramp data flow:

| Component | In scope |
|---|---|
| Next.js API server (bridge, payout, webhook, health routes) | ✅ |
| Soroban smart contracts (`escrow`, `treasury`, `fee-manager`, `multisig-authority`) | ✅ |
| Browser frontend (wallet interaction, localStorage, service worker) | ✅ |
| CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, container registry, Terraform) | ✅ |
| On-ramp provider registry (ADR-007) | ✅ |
| Field-level PII encryption layer (`src/lib/security/`, repositories) | ✅ |
| Key Management System (KMS) integration for envelope encryption | ✅ |
| PostgreSQL database (PII columns, audit logs) | ✅ |

**Out of scope:** Allbridge Protocol internals, Paycrest backend, Stellar/Base consensus layers,
user's own wallet key management.

## 2. Assets

| Asset | C | I | A | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BASE_PRIVATE_KEY` — payout wallet | Critical | Critical | High | Server-only; never in browser bundle |
| `PAYCREST_API_KEY` / `PAYCREST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | High | High | Medium | HMAC signing + webhook validation |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` / KMS key ARN | Critical | Critical | High | #692 field-level encryption key |
| `DATABASE_URL` | High | High | High | |
| Beneficiary bank account + name (PII) | High | High | Medium | Encrypted at field level (#692) |
| Escrow contract settlement authority | Critical | Critical | High | Multi-sig required (#629) |
| User stablecoin funds (in-flight) | N/A | Critical | High | Non-custodial; server never holds |
| Transaction history (localStorage) | Medium | Medium | Low | No private keys stored |
| On-ramp provider API keys | High | High | Medium | Per-provider credential isolation |
| CI/CD secrets (registry, deploy tokens) | High | High | Medium | Scoped per environment |
| Audit log records | Medium | High | Medium | Integrity-critical for compliance |

## 4. Actors

| Actor | Trust Level | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Authenticated user | Low–Medium | Controls wallet; crafts inputs; no server-side session |
| Paycrest webhook sender | Medium | HMAC-SHA512 verified; IP allowlist recommended |
| On-ramp provider API | Medium | Per-credential isolation; no cross-provider privilege |
| CI/CD pipeline | High | Has deploy credentials; supply-chain risk |
| Database administrator | High | Full plaintext access to unencrypted columns |
| KMS service (AWS/GCP) | Trusted | Key custodian for envelope encryption |
| External auditor | High | Read-only code + staging access |
| Malicious browser extension | None | May intercept wallet interactions |
| Contract attacker | None | May probe escrow for replay/reentrancy |
| Insider threat | Elevated | Has credential access; mitigated by audit logs |

## 8. Out-of-Scope Risks (Accepted)

| Risk | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Stellar or Base consensus failure | Protocol-level; beyond our control; mitigated by timeouts + refund paths |
| Paycrest API outages | Non-custodial; handled via retry + user notification |
| User's own wallet compromise | By design — non-custodial, we never hold keys |
| Allbridge bridge protocol bugs | Mitigated by bridge status polling + manual resolution runbook |
| Force majeure (data centre failure) | Mitigated by multi-region failover in Terraform + DR plan |

## 9. Contributor Summary

This threat model is a **shared responsibility**. Contributors working on security-relevant
areas should:

1. **Open a PR updating this document** when adding a new API route, data store, external
   integration, or credential.
2. **Reference the relevant threat IDs** (e.g. `TM-008`) in commit messages and PR descriptions.
3. **Do not merge** a PR that introduces new High/Critical threats without filing a tracking
   issue and adding a row to §6.
4. **Run the smoke suite** (`npm run test:e2e -- e2e/smoke.spec.ts`) against your branch
   before raising a PR.
5. **Check `SECURITY.md`** for the security audit checklist before every deploy.
